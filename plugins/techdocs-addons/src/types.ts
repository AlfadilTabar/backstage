   * location `TechDocsAddonLocations.COMPONENT`, whose `component` would be
   * the react component that would be rendered in place of all instances of
   * the markdown illustrated above.
   *
   * The `@backstage/techdocs-addons` plugin would need to be updated to, in
   * cases where such addons had been registered, find all instances of the
   * rendered markdown (e.g. `<a href="{entityRef}">CatalogEntityCard</a>`) and
   * replace them with react portals to the addon component.
